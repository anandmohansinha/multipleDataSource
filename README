STEP 1:
    Add database related properties so that spring data jpa can create datasource.




NOTE:
Spring Boot auto-configuration tries to configure the beans automatically based on the dependencies
 added to the classpath. Since you have the JPA dependency on your classpath, Spring Boot tries to
 automatically configure a JPA DataSource. The problem is, you havenâ€™t given Spring the complete
  information it needs to perform the auto-configuration.
