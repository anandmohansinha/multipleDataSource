Spring Data MongoRepository Update
=====================================
The MongoRepository provides save() and saveAll() methods to update the entities.
 If entities are already available in collection in Mongo database,
 then they will be updated otherwise they will be inserted as new entities.


datasource Properties
=========================
 you'll need to add some properties to application.properties with the spring.datasource prefix


 JPA transaction can not handle mongodb and Mongo transaction manager can not handle JPA
 =======================================================================================


STEP 1:
    Add database related properties so that spring data jpa can create datasource.




NOTE:
Spring Boot auto-configuration tries to configure the beans automatically based on the dependencies
 added to the classpath. Since you have the JPA dependency on your classpath, Spring Boot tries to
 automatically configure a JPA DataSource. The problem is, you havenâ€™t given Spring the complete
  information it needs to perform the auto-configuration.
